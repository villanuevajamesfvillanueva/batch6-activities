                    <h1><strong>"One Step At A Time"<strong></h1>
                        <p>This homework is about a concept, an idea, or a thought online about a best practice related to web development or software engineering that
                            can be summarized into a statement. Sources can range from a tweet, a blog post, from a book, etc. My chosen concept came form this
                            blog post by a developer named Steve Klabnik. You can find it <a href="https://www.codementor.io/learn-programming/steve-klabniks-9-words-advice-programming-beginners"><strong><i>here</i></strong>.</a>
                            The first tip talks about handling tasks and sticking to one task at a time.</p>
                        <p>For a beginner like me, tackling programming tasks that might be relatively easy to others can be daunting since I don't have the necessary skills and
                            experience yet to code confidently. There can be a lot of things to consider and worry about and things can get complex pretty quickly.
                            This is where this tip becomes incredibly helpful. By breaking down a complex task into smaller, manageable bits, the load becomes lighter
                            and it becomes easier to complete each task both physically and mentally. Something that adds to the beauty of this idea is that it doesn't just apply to
                            programming. In problem solving in other fields, also even in our daily struggles, we can use it too. So whenever I'm faced with a really challenging problem,
                            I'll keep in mind to take a single step at a time and progress steadily, until I get to the finish line.
